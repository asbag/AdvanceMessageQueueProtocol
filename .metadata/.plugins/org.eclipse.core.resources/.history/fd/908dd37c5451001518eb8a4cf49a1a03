 * 
 * The main idea behind Work Queues (aka: Task Queues) is to avoid doing a resource-intensive task immediately 
 * and having to wait for it to complete. Instead we schedule the task to be done later. We encapsulate a task as a 
 * message and send it to a queue. A worker process running in the background will pop the tasks and eventually 
 * execute the job. When you run many workers the tasks will be shared between them.
 * This concept is especially useful in web applications where it's impossible to handle a complex task during a short HTTP request window.
